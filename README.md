# Automatic-Waste-Segregation-System-Smart-Dustbin-
Designed and developed an Arduino-based smart dustbin that automatically segregates wet, dry, and metal waste using IR, moisture, and inductive sensors. Implemented real-time logic in Arduino IDE, coordinating servo and stepper motors to deliver a reliable automation prototype for smart waste management.
